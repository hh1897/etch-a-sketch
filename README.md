# etch-a-sketch
 
	A simple etch-a-sketch design: 

		The grid has a min size of 1 and a max size of 40 x 40.

		You can begin drawing by simply selecting a grid size and then clicking inside the grid.
		
		You can choose a colour in the options panel, or select the rainbow pencil for random colours when drawing. 

		When drawing click once to begin drawing, then move the mouse. Press the left mouse button again to stop drawing. 

		Use the eraser the same way as the pencil to remove any mistakes.

		The New Grid button will clear the current grid, and you will have to input a new grid size to make a new grid.

	Reflection, and the skills I learnt from this task:
		I have developed my knowledge on CSS flex features, and the Javascript HTML DOM.
